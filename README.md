# üí´About Me :
Hello there! I'm Tr·∫ßn Minh Kh√¥i, a passionate coder currently studying at Duy T√¢n University. I've crafted a strong vision of the open-source world and technology, and I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of myself through this Git portfolio.

With knowledge and skills in programming, I've honed proficiency in using PHP and Vue.js to create visually appealing and efficient web applications. Understanding databases is also a vital part of my skill set. I can work with PHPMyAdmin to manage and optimize databases, ensuring smooth and reliable operation of my applications.

I've also undergone a 3-month English course at CG Academy's Cebu branch in the Philippines. It was an exciting experience that improved my English communication skills and opened doors to global interactions.

Beyond coding, I hold a deep passion for sports. Sports help me maintain a healthy body and a refreshed mind, creating a conducive environment to focus on programming and learning.

This Git portfolio serves as a platform where I share the projects and accomplishments I've achieved. I hope you'll find valuable and engaging insights about me through the showcased projects and endeavors. Thank you for taking the time to explore about me and my work.
